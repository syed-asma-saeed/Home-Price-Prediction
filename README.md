# Home-Price-Prediction

## Description
This project aims to predict housing prices in Boston using several machine learning models. The dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sakshisatre/the-boston-housing-dataset) contains various features about houses in Boston, such as crime rate, number of rooms, property age, and more. The goal is to build and evaluate different regression models to accurately predict the prices of houses based on these features.

## Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:
1. **Data Import and Libraries**: Importing necessary libraries and the dataset.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preprocessing the data, including handling missing values and duplicates.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Generating summary statistics and visualizing the data to understand the distribution and relationships between variables.
4. **Feature Scaling**: Scaling the features to improve model performance.
5. **Model Building**: Building and evaluating multiple regression models including Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, and XGBoost Regressor.
6. **Model Evaluation**: Comparing the performance of the models using the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE).

## Result
This analysis demonstrates the application of various machine learning models to predict housing prices in Boston and provides insights into which models perform best for this specific dataset.
